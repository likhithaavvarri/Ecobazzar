EcoBazaar â€” Eco-Friendly E-Commerce Platform (Work in Progress)

EcoBazaar is a backend project built using Spring Boot, designed to promote sustainable and eco-conscious shopping. It provides a platform where users can browse, add, and purchase environmentally friendly products while encouraging sellers to list green alternatives.

The main goal of EcoBazaar is to create a clean, efficient, and secure e-commerce backend that supports features like product management, cart handling, and order processing â€” all implemented using a structured, scalable architecture.

The application follows a 3-layer Spring Boot design (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository) and includes JWT-based authentication for secure user access.
